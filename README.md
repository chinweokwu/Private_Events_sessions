## Assotiations - PRIVATE EVENTS

This project is a part of the Ruby on Rails module in the Microverse curriculum.
We build a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users 
to create events and then manage user signups.

- A user can register, login, logout, edit and delete own account
- A user can create many new events and attend many other events
- A user can see the list with upcoming and past events
- Each event has many attendees
